# Daily LeetCode Challenges

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving **daily LeetCode problems** and documenting the entire thought process behind each solution.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here
- âœ… **Daily Solutions**: Each file contains the solution for the problem of the day.  
- âœ… **Multiple Approaches**: From brute force to optimized solutions, showing the thought process.  
- âœ… **Well-Documented Code**: Each solution file includes problem details, approach, and explanations.  
- âœ… **Learning Log**: Failures, fixes, and final insights are captured to track progress.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build a consistent problem-solving habit
- Improve DSA and coding interview skills
- Maintain a portfolio of coding solutions
